# Broken Kingdom Campaign: The Hero of Evergreen

This is a project for the game [OpenClonk] (https://www.openclonk.org/). The goal is to create a campaign, a series of scenarios, that tell a story happening after the official campaign of OpenClonk.

## Introduction of the campaign

```
The king is dead.
An unknown assailant found a way into the castle of King Harx, who later was called 'The Cruel'. Against all odds, Harx The Cruel was killed. The assailant quickly vanished, leaving chaos in the keep. Afterwards, many citizens claimed to have seen that person, even helped the cause. Some of which who boasted were killed by angry mobs. Not everyone hated Harx as passionately as others. But too many did. They found Harx' system of taxation unjust and his claimed monopoly over all oil oppressive. However, soon everyone realised that Harx The Cruel had not been the monster they thought he was. He had been an economic genius, managing the kingdom's finances in a carefully balanced way. His diplomatic skills were unmatched as he maintained relationships with neighbouring kingdoms. Always knowing how to exert promises of friendship and threats of war. Without his leadership, the kingdom fell apart. Many small counties declared independence and a civil war erupted; once peaceful neighbours now viciously fought over resources that had once been shared. Other kingdoms took the opportunity to strike and seized the borderlands.

It has been five years since Harx' death. A relative peace has been established in the area that had once been the very heart of the kingdom. A senate, formed by aristocrats, gathered enough forces to get the population back under control. But with many fertile grounds lost, feeding everyone now poses a challenge as well as powerful enemies who still observe the situation closely. A rigorous military service was created to maintain a military strength capable of defending the New Republic, as the new nation was called. Though many of the inhabitants still referred to it as 'The Broken Kingdom'.
