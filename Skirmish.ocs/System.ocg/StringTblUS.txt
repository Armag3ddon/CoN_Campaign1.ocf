# Intro

MsgIntro1=Finally, the encampment. I'm exhausted!
MsgIntro2=Halt! State your business.
MsgIntro3=These are my orders. The general wants to see us.
MsgIntro4=Sir!
MsgIntro5=At ease, soldier. Just open the gate for us, please.
MsgIntro6=Yes, Sir!
MsgIntro7=Let's go, everyone.
MsgIntro8=General! Colonel Gertner, reporting as ordered.
MsgIntro8_Paula=...Colonel?!
MsgIntro9=Colonel. Where is your hat?
MsgIntro10=Excuse me, Sir. Right here, Sir.
MsgIntro11=Very good, Colonel.
MsgIntro12=Your men must be tired, Colonel. Go send them to fetch something to eat. We have much to discuss and I will give you the details in a minute.
MsgIntro13=Yes, Sir.
MsgIntro14=Err...men! You go get yourselves something to eat...uhm...dismissed!
MsgIntro15=Sure thing, SIR!
MsgIntro16_Single=Come one, Newbie. The <i>Colonel</i> gave us orders.
MsgIntro16_Multi=Come one, Newbie. The <i>Colonel</i> gave us orders.
MsgIntro17=Cook! Fix us something up to eat, will ya? We had a long trip.
MsgIntro18=What is that? No 'Hellos' anymore, nowadays? Alright, then. Have a seat, Your Highness!
MsgIntro19=Hah. I like the cook, already.
MsgIntro20=Bread. Very fresh. Right now, the best I've got. For a hot meal, you have to wait until this evening.
MsgIntro21=Thanks, sweetie. We appreciate this.
MsgIntro22=Why are you giving Samuel such a hard time? What's up with him being a Colonel?
MsgIntro23=Cutting right to the chase, yes, Newbie? Well, I probably should have kept quiet.
MsgIntro24=Well...I didn't know he was a Colonel. He never really told me his rank. It was clear that he outranked me but a <i>Colonel</i>? I don't understand that.
MsgIntro25=Is that something special? A Colonel?
MsgIntro26=A high ranking officer? In a watchtower at the Kutorian border? Sure is! I never heard of a Colonel being stationed along the wall. A Captain, yeah. Maybe a Major. But that's it.
MsgIntro27=Higher ranks are far too valuable to be wasted at the border...I can't believe it. He never wore his beret before.
MsgIntro28=Why should he have told you why he was stationed there anyway?
MsgIntro29_Friendly=Oh Newbie. Us two, we go way back. Samuel was part of the force which helped my village against the raiders. He recruited me into the army.
MsgIntro29_Unfriendly=Hm? Oh. It is just unusual, don't you think?
MsgIntro30=Ah, that was nice.
MsgIntro31=We should probably check on Sam now. I guess he'll have his orders ready.

# Briefing

MsgBriefing1=Okay, everyone. Come with me. I have orders from the general.
MsgBriefing2=We get on top of the observation island for the briefing. Follow me.
MsgBriefing3=Sure...
MsgBriefing4=Colonel.
MsgBriefing5=At ease, gunnery sergeant. Just passing through. Give us some room over there.
MsgBriefing6=So, <i>Colonel</i>. Tell us the magic plan.
MsgBriefing7=Paula...
MsgBriefing8=What? You want to pull rank on me?
MsgBriefing9=No, Paula. I won't. I certainly could, now that you point it out.
MsgBriefing10=I know very well that I never told you my rank. I didn't want things to be awkward between us, you know? I never fancied all those 'Sirs' and salutes.
MsgBriefing11=Well, thank you very much!
MsgBriefing12=Stop it now! What do you want me to do? Apologise for not wearing my hat?!
MsgBriefing13=It is up to you to settle the argument. What do you do?
MsgBriefing13_A=Side with Paula.
MsgBriefing13_B=Stay neutral.
MsgBriefing13_C=Side with Samuel.
MsgBriefing14_A=You could have said something, at least when it became clear that we rejoin the army.
MsgBriefing14_B=Please, you two. Isn't there a battle to fight?
MsgBriefing14_C=Come now, Paula. I'm sure Samuel didn't mean any harm with this.
MsgBriefing15_A=Careful now, Newbie. I cut Paula some slack because I've known her for years. But you are still talking to your commanding officer.
MsgBriefing15_B=Yeah...yes. You are absolutely right, Newbie.
MsgBriefing15_C=Yeah, sure. You side with your most favourite person anyway.
MsgBriefing15_Memory1=(Samuel will remember this)
MsgBriefing15_Memory2=(You stayed neutral on this)
MsgBriefing15_Memory3=(Paula will remember this)
MsgBriefing16_A_Single=Don't snap at Newbie, Sam, when it's me you are angry with. But it doesn't matter. Let's talk battle, will ya?
MsgBriefing16_A_Multi=Don't snap at the Newbies, Sam, when it's me you are angry with. But it doesn't matter. Let's talk battle, will ya?
MsgBriefing16_B=Sure, I guess. There are more important things at hand.
MsgBriefing16_C=Paula, enough. Please calm your anger now. We need to discuss battle tactics.
MsgBriefing17=It's looking grim. Not only does the enemy outnumber us, they're also in the way of us getting to Evergreen.
MsgBriefing18=It's pure luck the general is here. He was on a routine check along the border when the attack hit.
MsgBriefing19=Unfortunately, he didn't bring his full staff with him. Major general Guinot is occupied with managing provisions, so I will be the general's tactical advisor.
MsgBriefing20=Meaning you will not lead us into battle.
MsgBriefing21=Exactly. You will lead the attack. The enemy has total air superiority because they captured a full unit of pilots a couple of days ago. For now, the general managed to hold the line with artillery.
MsgBriefing22=But sooner or later, air strikes will do us in. So we need those pilots. They are held underground. We have secretly mined a tunnel, so a strike team has got a chance.
MsgBriefing23=I will oversee a general assault but that is just a distraction. You will do the rescue mission. I assign a squad of pioneers to you.
MsgBriefing24=They need to construct a bridge across some lava lakes. You must protect them while they do that and then fight your way to the prisoners when the bridge is done.
MsgBriefing25=Expect some resistance. We will occupy most of them but they won't just leave the prisoners unguarded. However, work as fast as you can. Men up here will be dieing.
MsgBriefing26_Single=Newbie. You have some experience now. So I'll promote you to Corporal, so you can give orders. Most troops here come from the watchtowers and are still green.
MsgBriefing26_Multi=Newbies. You have some experience now. So I'll promote you to Corporals, so you can give orders. Most troops here come from the watchtowers and are still green.
MsgBriefing27=Any questions? No? Good. I have written orders ready for you, so you can get yourself some weapons from the armory.
MsgBriefing28_Single=Okay, Newbie. It's getting serious. Let's get down to the arsenal.
MsgBriefing28_Multi=Okay, Newbies. It's getting serious. Let's get down to the arsenal.
MsgBriefing29=We are in for something. You go and get whatever you need. Show your orders to the guard, will ya?
MsgBriefing30=Pioneers reporting in, Sir!
MsgBriefing31_Single=Soldiers. We are ready as soon as the Corporal has got some weapons. Stand ready.
MsgBriefing31_Multi=Soldiers. We are ready as soon as the Corporals have got some weapons. Stand ready.

# First Assault

MsgFirstAssault1=Attention, soldiers!
MsgFirstAssault2=The attack will start soon. We will begin at the same time and work as fast as we can.
MsgFirstAssault3_Single=You will listen to what commands the Corporal gives you.
MsgFirstAssault3_Multi=You will listen to what commands the Corporals give you.
MsgFirstAssault4=On a 'Advance', carefully proceed forward with the bridge. Everyone not carrying the bridge will provide cover from missiles.
MsgFirstAssault5=On a 'Halt', bridge-carriers will stop.
MsgFirstAssault6=On a 'Fall back', you back up and get out of trouble.
MsgFirstAssault7=And I heard you guys are pretty good at dynamite chucking. So, on a 'Blast' command, you hit them with a bunch of sticks.
MsgFirstAssault8=Understood?
MsgFirstAssault9=Yes, Sir!
MsgFirstAssault10=For controlling the squad, use the Command button now available on your GUI or press 'C'.
MsgFirstAssault11=In the Command menu, you can select the desired command. You can also press a number key associated with a command.
MsgFirstAssault12=Sound the attack.
MsgFirstAssault13=That was the signal. We start now!

# Paula Dialogue

MsgPaula1=Is Sam ready yet?
MsgPaulaA1=No, he's still with the general.
MsgPaula2=Well, then. It is no use waiting here. Look around, familiarise yourself with the camp and the people, will ya?
MsgPaulaA2=Are you alright?
MsgPaula3_Friendly=Sure, Newbie. Thanks for asking. I was just surprised, nothing major. I'll be good.
MsgPaula3_Unfriendly1=What do you mean?
MsgPaula3_Unfriendly2=You seemed to be upset with Sam.
MsgPaula3_Unfriendly3=Jumping to conclusions, are we? That's a bit presumptuous, Newbie.
MsgPaulaLeave=I'll have a look around.
MsgPaulaPrep1=Ready to go?
MsgPaulaPrepA1=Ready!
MsgPaulaPrepA1_Safety=You sure?
MsgPaulaPrepA1_Safety2=Err, no.
MsgPaulaPrepA1_Safety3=Yes!
MsgPaulaPrep2_Positive=Okay.
MsgPaulaPrep2_Negative=What about the others? Everyone should be here.
MsgPaulaPrepA2=I don't know what weapons to get.
MsgPaulaPrep3=I've seen the details. We'll try to construct bridges over lava crevices.
MsgPaulaPrep3_Short=We'll construct|bridges.
MsgPaulaPrep4=So, get some ranged weapons, to fight off any enemy marksman.
MsgPaulaPrep4_Short=You need|ranged weapons.
MsgPaulaPrep5=But it will also be your responsibility to protect the pioneers when they do their work. Better pack a shield.
MsgPaulaPrepA3=I'm worried.
MsgPaulaPrep6_AllNeg=Now is no time for worries. Pull yourself together.
MsgPaulaPrep6_Neg=I sympathise with you. Just try and stay focussed, will ya?
MsgPaulaPrep6_Pos=I understand, Newbie. I was also worried when I got into my first fights. But I've got your back, we'll make it.
MsgPaulaPrep6_AllPos=Oh, Newbie! I keep forgetting you're new to this all. I'll protect you, we'll make it. Okay?
MsgPaulaPrepLeave=Not yet.

# Samuel Dialogue

MsgSamuel1=Are you ready?
MsgSamuelA1=Yes.
MsgSamuel2_Positive=Alright.
MsgSamuel2_Negative=It seems that not everyone is here. Let's wait.
MsgSamuelLeave=Not yet.

# Prisoner Dialogue

MsgPrisoner1=I am not supposed to talk to anyone.
MsgPrisoner1_Short=I shouldn't|talk.
MsgPrisonerA1=Why?
MsgPrisoner2=Because I am a prisoner. I thought that was obvious.
MsgPrisoner2_Short=Because I am|a prisoner.
MsgPrisoner3=Smart answer for a prisoner.
MsgPrisoner4=So? I already am imprisoned.
MsgPrisonerA2=Who are you?
MsgPrisoner5=Is your job to interrogate the prisoner then? Well, it is no secret. I already told my story.
MsgPrisoner5_Short=My story|is simple.
MsgPrisoner6=I am a merchant that happens to be from Kutor. Alas! No one told me that we were to invade you or else I would have stayed clear of the Republic.
MsgPrisoner6_Short=I am a merchant|from Kutor.
MsgPrisoner7=Now I am charged with espionage, of course. No one believes that you just accidentally got caught between the lines.
MsgPrisoner7_Short=I'm charged|with espionage.
MsgPrisoner8=I guess I got lucky that there's this task here to do. The general already threatened to shoot me.
MsgPrisoner8_Short=The general wanted|to shoot me.
MsgPrisonerA3=Why have you attacked us?
MsgPrisoner9=What? Why do you ask me? Obviously, our king has decided that the time was right to seize your land.
MsgPrisoner9_Short=Why we|attacked you?
MsgPrisoner10=Whether or not this is a wise decision, I don't know. Really, I don't have any military experience.
MsgPrisoner10_Short=I don't know!
MsgPrisoner11=But I guess this is how the world works. Some ruler wants more land, so armies go to war.
MsgPrisoner11_Short=But this is how|politics work.
MsgPrisoner12=From what I heard, your king Harx planned his own little campaign into Kutor once.
MsgPrisoner12_Short=Harx once wanted|to invade us.
MsgPrisonerA4=Will your people free you?
MsgPrisoner13=What kind of question is that. Sure, I think. After all, that is why you would call them 'my people'.
MsgPrisoner13_Short=What? Will my|people free me?
MsgPrisoner14=But don't get me wrong. I have nothing against you folk. If you would set me free, I'd be equally happy.
MsgPrisoner14_Short=Probably? Maybe you'll|set me free.
MsgPrisoner15=Republicans are, after all, my customers. I came here to sell Kutorian delicacies.
MsgPrisoner15_Short=Republicans are|good customers.
MsgPrisoner16=But with this war, I figure, Kutorian food will be out of style for a few years.
MsgPrisoner16_Short=But now my|business is ruined!
MsgPrisoner17=So, if I don't lose my life, at least my livelihood is already lost.
MsgPrisonerLeave=Then don't talk.

# Sergeant Miller Dialogue (General's guard)

MsgMiller1=I'm on guard duty, %s. No time to talk.

# Cook Dialogue

MsgCook1=Dinner's not ready yet.
MsgCookA1=What are you cooking?
MsgCook2=Mushroom stew. Nothing fancy, I know. But beggars can't be choosers, right? Wipf steak is currently not in stock.
MsgCook2_Short=Best mushroom|stew in the area.
MsgCookA2=How much food do we have?
MsgCook3=Sorry, %s, but I cannot give you that information. The general gave strict orders.
MsgCook3_Short=Sorry, provision info|is top secret.
MsgCook4=We can't have people going around, spreading rumors about a food shortage and lower the morale.
MsgCook4_Short=General's orders.
MsgCook5=So, be content with this: there is enough food for now, will ya?
MsgCookA3=How is the battle faring?
MsgCook6=From what I've heard: it's bad out there. The enemy has dug in, we are dug in. It's a stalemate right now.
MsgCook6_Short=The fighting is|pretty grim.
MsgCook7=It's been five days and every new day, there are fewer meals to cook.
MsgCook7_Short=Five days and|nothing changed.
MsgCook8=The last that I've heard is that the soldiers started to call the battlefield 'No Man's Land'. Not a pretty name.
MsgCook8_Short=The battlefield is|called 'No Man's Land'.
MsgCook9=Both sides continue to do charges and run into heavy resistance. And the constant artillery bombardment drives the soldiers mad.
MsgCook10=The general is eager to press on, saying we must reach Evergreen as fast as possible. So we fight.
MsgCook10_Short=General says we|need to reach Evergreen.
MsgCook11=But our troops are inexperienced, green. To be honest, you don't like you've seen much fighting yourself.
MsgCookLeave=Okay, I'll wait.

MsgGunny4=Excuse me, but I just happened to miss the general's insignia that make me answer to YOU.

MsgMedic2_Short=Painkillers? Better|pick a number.
MsgMedicA2=How are the wounded?
MsgMedic3=Miserable, of course. What we have here, I wouldn't even call a field hospital.
MsgMedic3_Short=The wounded are|not in well shape.
MsgMedic4=The constant pounding of the shells rattles your every bone. That is no condition in which to recover from bullet wounds.
MsgMedic4_Short=The shelling|doesn't help.
MsgMedic5=Unless we get to move to a better facility pretty soon, some of the wounded might not make it.
MsgMedic5_Short=Ideally we move|everyone soon.
MsgMedicLeave=No. Sorry to bother you.

# Corporal Smith Dialogue

MsgSmith1=Halt, %s.
MsgSmithA1=Corporal. What are you guarding?
MsgSmith2=The arsenal.
MsgSmith2_Short=I guard|the armory.
MsgSmith3=Can I get some new gear? My old stuff isn't really up to the task.
MsgSmith3_Short=Can I get new gear?
MsgSmith4=Not unless you show me a permission slip from your commanding officer.
MsgSmith4_Short=Not without permission.
MsgSmith5=He is currently talking with the general.
MsgSmith5_Short=My commanding|officer is busy.
MsgSmith6=Well, then I guess you have to wait for him to finish. Waiting is the soldier's dearest task.
MsgSmith6_Short=Well, then the|answer is no.
MsgSmithA2=Corporal. Is the fighting bad?
MsgSmith7=Another green soldier? Great. Just what we need.
MsgSmith7_Short=You have no|experience, right?
MsgSmith8=And you are not green anymore?
MsgSmith8_Short=And you?
MsgSmith9=I am not. You don't get to be a corporal without seeing some action. And I can tell you, the action around here isn't pleasant.
MsgSmith9_Short=No. That's why|I am a corporal.
MsgSmith10=The Kutorians surprised us. I came here together with General Terry. This place was perfect for an ambush and the general knew that.
MsgSmith10_Short=The Kutorians|surprised us.
MsgSmith11=We were prepared for an attack...just not for the strength of their force. I couldn't believe how many had already crossed the border.
MsgSmith11_Short=They outnumbered us.
MsgSmith12=They had the numbers and a lot of heavy weapons. Many died in that first attack.
MsgSmith13=Only because the general thought quickly enough and rallied us did we survive. Still, it was a massacre.
MsgSmith13_Short=But the general|saved us.
MsgSmith14=Guarding this post will keep me away from the fighting for a while. I don't envy you for going in.
MsgSmithA3=Corporal. Here are my orders.
MsgSmith15=Orders, you say? Let me see... yes, everything in order. Go get yourself whatever you need.
MsgSmith16=You are free to pass.
MsgSmithLeave=I will halt.
