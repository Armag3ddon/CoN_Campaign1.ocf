Page3=<i>My name is Gerald Jung. I am part of a mining operation and our job was to dig a tunnel to reach the Forward Bunker. I don't know what is wrong with the Dark Forest but something is.</i>

Page5=<i>And now it got me. I figure that by now everyone believes me dead. I almost am. If you read this, turn around before it is too late. To Emily I say: I love you.</i>
