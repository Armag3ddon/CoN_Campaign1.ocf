The Watchtower

You are a young clonk who just got drafted into the military service. After a hard and efficient basic training, you got your first assignment. The first time ever you left Evergreen, the capital of the New Republic, which hardly saw any battle even after Harx' death. You were sent to Watchtower 7 which is part of the defence wall along the Kutorian border. Many in the republican senate belief that Kutor is not able or not willing to attack, therefore many troops have been reassigned to other parts of the nation. The watchtowers are left with just skeleton crews. Beside you, only three others man Watchtower 7. What presented itself as an exciting adventure, turned out to be a test of endurance, as you are to do mundane tasks all day long. While the rest of the crew is friendly enough, they refuse to answer your questions on their past battle experiences. They are not from Evergreen, so you know they must have seen their share. Given time, you hope to hear their stories. It will not get more exciting than this at Watchtower 7. Of that you are sure.
