# Intro

MsgIntro1=Day 41 of my assignment to watchtower 7:\nNothing to report. Scheduled for today is the blasting of the new emergency tunnel.
MsgIntro2=|Personal note: The crew still calls me Newbie.
MsgIntroPaula_Single=Hey Newbie!\nGet down here and help me with this, will ya?
MsgIntroPaula_Multi=Hey Newbies!\nGet down here and help me with this, will ya?

# Elevator

MsgElevator1=What...?
MsgElevator2=Woah. Careful down there, get out the way!
MsgElevator3=Anyone hurt? No? Good.
MsgElevator_Single=The elevator is stuck now. Newbie, can you clear the crates away, will ya?
MsgElevator_Multi=The elevator is stuck now. Newbies, can you clear the crates away, will ya?

# Attack

MsgAttack1=Thanks, Newbie. Let's get to blasting this escape tunnel, shall we? We're long overdue with this. If only we had more clonks here...
MsgAttack2=Anyway. We work with what we have, right?|AAATTENTION! EXPLOSION COMING!
MsgAttack3=Keep it down there, will ya? Everbody knows.
MsgAttack4=Heh. Never mind Samuel, old grump he is.
MsgAttack5=Perfect! This looks good. Let's see.
MsgAttack6=What the hell?
MsgAttack7=What is going on down here? What was THAT? I carefully measured those the explosive, you know...
MsgAttack8=Quiet Sam! We've been attacked. Someone planted powder kegs under the tower.
MsgAttack9=Wait a second. There's a tunnel filled with enemies down here? You guys better come up. I'll secure the elevator.
MsgAttack10=...and then there was a soldier, firing the at the barrels. Actually, he looked like he was from Kutor.
MsgAttack11=Kutorian soliders?! BEHIND the wall?
MsgAttack12=I know. And...wait, where's Eric? ERIC! They killed him...
MsgAttack13=Also destroyed the gun.
MsgAttack14=Sam!
MsgAttack15=What? Eric is dead, we can't do anything about that. But WE still live. And are now without a heavy weapon.
MsgAttack16=They must have planned this for a long time. Digging below the wall and ambushing us from this side.
MsgAttack17=They cut us off. We can't get any messages out.
MsgAttack18=So, this is a siege now?
MsgAttack19=Exactly, Newbie. And the timing is perfect. We're almost out of supplies, the next delivery was due to tomorrow. I guess we won't get that now. We need to stack up new supplies.
MsgAttack20=Wait. That sounds like...INCOMING!
MsgAttack21=Okay, everyone. Let's get to work, will ya?

# Question 1

MsgQuestion1_1=What lies beyond the western gates?
MsgQuestion1_2=Sam opened the gate, has he? We shouldn't go out there. It is not safe.
MsgQuestion1_3=Why?
MsgQuestion1_4=Beyond the gate lies Kutor...but, you know that already. Directly in front of the gate is a forest.
MsgQuestion1_5=But, you saw that already. We just call it the Dark Forest. It is very dark in there. People got lost and never returned.
MsgQuestion1_6=There are hostile creatures living within. Do not go beyond the outer gate, will ya?
MsgQuestion1_7=Sam shouldn't have opened that gate. We could have found another way.
MsgQuestion1_A=Well...I guess you're right.
MsgQuestion1_B=Sam thinks practical. We need bread to withstand the siege.
MsgQuestion1_Remember=Paula will remember this.
MsgQuestion1_A_1=Glad you agree. However, what's done is done. After all, Sam is our commander.
MsgQuestion1_B_1=Uh...sure. If you think so. Sam is our commander, we follow his orders.
MsgQuestion1_Memory=(Paula will remember this)
MsgQuestion1_8=Anyway. Don't set foot into that damned forest, ok? Back to work now, Newbie.

# Main Quest (also Question 2)

MsgMQ1=Okay, everyone. Gather round.
MsgMQ2=The tower is kind of secured, for now. We haven't received any help, so it is safe assume that help is not on its way.
MsgMQ3=It is our job now to break the siege.
MsgMQ4=Are you serious?
MsgMQ5=Yes, Paula, very serious.
MsgMQ6=Right now, the enemy simply outguns us. So we need a new cannon to fight back. Unfortunately, we don't have any metal left.
MsgMQ7=But there are still some reserves left in the Forward Bunker.
MsgMQ8=But Sam, that's well into the...
MsgMQ9=...the Dark Forest. I know. Not that far though and I don't see any other option.
MsgMQ10=What is the Forward Bunker?
MsgMQ11_S=A supply storage from the time when King Harx planned an invasion into Kutor. It's hidden on their ground.
MsgMQ11_P=King Harx once planned an attack on Kutor and placed these supply storages along the border. On their side, actually.
MsgMQ12=And that is where we need to go. First, I want to scout out the situation, so let's get on the roof.
MsgMQ13=Hurry up!
MsgMQ14_Single=Come on. Paula, help me with the scouting post, Newbie you go watch our backs.
MsgMQ14_Multi=Come on. Paula, help me with the scouting post, Newbies you go watch our backs.
MsgMQ15=Better make this quick.
MsgMQ16=Let's see...
MsgMQ17=Ah, yes. There it is, seemingly untouched. Very good.
MsgMQ18=What..? We've been discovered. EVERYONE GET DOWN RIGHT NOW!
MsgMQ19=PAULAAA!
MsgMQ20=She is alright, for now.
MsgMQ21_Single=Newbie. Change of plans. Paula can't move like this and I...I need to stay here. I'm the best medic that we have right now.
MsgMQ21_Multi=Newbies. Change of plans. Paula can't move like this and I...I need to stay here. I'm the best medic that we have right now.
MsgMQ22=You must now go into the woods and retrieve that metal. It is the only way.
MsgMQ23=Sam....no...it's too dangerous.
MsgMQ24=The screechers, they...
MsgMQ25=Don't worry, Paula. I have a plan. I fixed up one of the old Imperial flamethrowers I found during the inventory. We can use it to burn out the screecher's nests.
MsgMQ26=But..Sam...they are just animals. We can't simply kill them.
MsgMQ27=What are screechers?
MsgMQ28=Bats, living in the Dark Forest. They are quite hostile and will attack you and every light you bring into the woods.
MsgMQ29=You must deal with the screechers going through the forest.
MsgMQ_A=Samuel is right. If the screechers are in the way, we must take them out.
MsgMQ_B=Paula is right. We can't kill all those animals. I won't take the flamethrower.
MsgMQ30_A=Glad you see the sense in that. I left it by the Chemical Lab, it is fueled and ready to go.
MsgMQ30_B=Have it your way then. But I expect you to succeed, is that clear?
MsgMQ30_Memory=(Paula and Samuel will remember this)
MsgMQ31=Either way, we must hurry. The enemy won't see you in the thick forest, so I doubt you'll be attacked by planes. Just the screechers.
MsgMQ32=I'll open the outer gate for you.

# Cannon Construction

MsgCan1_S=Great job, Newbie.
MsgCan1_M=Great job, Newbies.
MsgCan2=Now we can finally give those guys a sample of their own medicine.
MsgCan3=Paula is getting better at the minute. But we need to hit them fast, meaning now.
MsgCan4=I need you to take up gun control. You mark the targets, I fire.
MsgCan5=While you were gone fetching that metal, I constructed a little bunker buster. Blowing up those fortifications will be a blast!
MsgCan6=Everything is ready. You point out the targets, I fire until the bunker is gone. Okay?
MsgCan7=Let's go.
MsgCan8=Just point me to the targets (Click)!
MsgCan9=Yeah! It's done!
MsgCan10=The siege is lifted. We start with strengthening this tower and try to contact other troops.
MsgCan11=SAM!
MsgCan12=Paula! You're up again?
MsgCan13=Yes. But that's not important right now. Look over there, to the north!
MsgCan14=Oh, shoot! That's a fully-fledged invasion force.
MsgCan15=SAM...
MsgCan16=I see it. It's the beacon. The beacon of Evergreen has been lit.
MsgCan17=We'll move out as soon as possible and abandon the tower. The beacons means all troops are recalled for defence. Evergreen is in danger.

# NPC Paula

MsgPaula1=Ah, Newbie! Great you made it down here. As you can see, everything is set up for the great bang.
MsgPaula2=All I need is the igniter. Could you bring it to me? I bet Samuel knows where is it.
MsgPaula2_Short=Could you be bring|me the igniter?
MsgPaula3=Do you have the igniter yet?
MsgPaulaWhereIsSam=Where is Samuel?
MsgPaulaSam=Sam? On the upper floor, doing his sacred inventory.
MsgPaulaGotIt=I have the igniter.
MsgPaulaBye=I'll be off.
MsgPaulaSR1=There you are, Newbie! C'mon, I need your help. I need to reinforce the tower walls to withstand the bombardment.
MsgPaulaSR1_Short=I need help reinforcing|this wall, Newbie.
MsgPaulaSR2=I can't operate the mine and work on this, unfortunately.
MsgPaulaSR3=Could you bring me a lorry filled with...say...40 rocks? Just put it next to me.
MsgPaulaSR4=There are plenty of rocks down in the cellar. The enemy seems to have no intentions of breaking in, so you should be safe.
MsgPaulaSR5=However, do stay clear of the tunnel we blew up, ok?
MsgPaulaSR5_Short=Don't go through|the new tunnel.
MsgPaulaSR6=Newbie! What's going through your mind?
MsgPaulaSRHowIsIt=How is it going?
MsgPaulaSRChatting=Worried, are ya? You know that I love idle chitchat. But right now, I'm afraid, there's is no time. Just get me those rocks, okay?
MsgPaulaSRIGo=I'll get to work!
MsgPaulaSRForwardGates=What lies beyond the western gates?
MsgPaulaSRDone=Here are the rocks you wanted.
MsgPaulaSRDone2=Great job, Newbie! Let me fix this up real quick, will ya?
MsgPaulaSRD2_Short=Great job!
MsgPaulaSRDoneSure=Are you sure?|I don't see the rocks, sorry.
MsgPaulaSRDone3=There. Good as new.
MsgPaulaSRDone4=Well, my work is done.
MsgPaulaSRWhatNext=What now?
MsgPaulaSRStartSamuel=Now, I think there is something Sam wants you to do.
MsgPaulaSRDoSamuel=Now, you better do what Sam asked you to do.
MsgPaulaSRDoneAll=Looks like all tasks are done for now. We should ask Sam what to do next.
MsgPaulaSRDAll_Short=Go speak|to Sam now.
MsgPaulaMQ1=Hey Newbie. Don't worry. I looks worse than it is.
MsgPaulaMQ1_Short=Hey! I'm ok.
MsgPaulaMQ2_Friendly=Don't let Sam give you a hard time because of this flamethrower. You made the right choice.
MsgPaulaMQ2_Unfriendly=Be careful with that flamethrower, will ya? It's a brutal device.
MsgPaulaMQ3=Apart from that: take care in that forest. It's not a nice place to be.
MsgPaulaMQ3_Short=Be careful in|that forest.
MsgPaulaMQ4=Everything okay?
MsgPaulaMQYes=Yes, I'll get to work.
MsgPaulaMQConcern1=How are you holding up?
MsgPaulaMQConcern2=Fine, thanks. I suffered worse during the upheaval.
MsgPaulaMQConcern3=Worse than being blasted?
MsgPaulaMQConcern4=Doesn't seem likely, does it? Yeah...my village got attacked by raiders. I was shot that night. Nearly didn't make it.
MsgPaulaMQC_Short=I got shot|before, you know?
MsgPaulaMQLight=I need light to enter the forest.
MsgPaulaMQLight_Friendly=Here, take these torches with you. It's not much but surely helps.
MsgPaulaMQLF_Short=Take these torches,|it'll help.
MsgPaulaMQLight_Friendly2=Those torches were all I have now. But you can make more in the Tools Workshop.
MsgPaulaMQLight_Unfriendly=That's a real problem in there, yes. Maybe ask Sam about some help, will ya?
MsgPaulaMQLU_Short=Sorry, I can't|help with light.

# NPC Samuel

MsgSamuel1=Please, don't bother me right now. I'm in the middle of the inventory.
MsgSamuel2=What is it now?
MsgSamuel3=You got what you wanted, now leave.
MsgSamuelGoGetIt=Ugh. Okay, fine. It's in the metal chest. But don't open any other chests, I'm not done yet.
MsgSamuelGoGetIt_Short=Fine. The igniter is|in the metal chest.
MsgSamuelINeedIgniter=Paula told me to bring her the igniter.
MsgSamuelChests=Hey! Don't you touch those chests. I'm doing an inventory.
MsgSamuelSR1=Mmmh, yes, yes. Newbie! As you heard, we need new supplies. We won't get the delivery.
MsgSamuelSR1_Short=I need you to|make new supplies.
MsgSamuelSR2=Normally we wouldn't do this but we don't have a choice. We need to prepare for a prolonged siege.
MsgSamuelSR3=There's some bags of seeds over there. Put it to good use, will ya? We need...25 loafs of bread. Just put them in the chests upstairs.
MsgSamuelSR4=Here. I open the western gate for you. I know this isn't exactly safe but we don't have a choice.
MsgSamuelSR4_Short=The western gate|is now open.
MsgSamuelSR5=There's soil out there and we need that. Go plant those seeds. And go look for water underground. Also, you can chop the trunks up. They're still good.
MsgSamuelSR5_Short=The trunks out|there can be chopped.
MsgSamuelSR6=I am quite busy, you know?
MsgSamuelSRWhatAre=What are you doing?
MsgSamuelSRNoSeeds=I lost all the seeds.
MsgSamuelSRNoSeeds2=Newbie, be more careful, will ya? Here are more seeds.
MsgSamuelSRNoS_Short=Here are|more seeds.
MsgSamuelSRIGo=Okay. I leave.
MsgSamuelSRBuildSomething=Working on something very important. Something to help us lift the siege. Also, I am doing something and not asking people questions all the time.
MsgSamuelSRBS_Short=I have work to do.
MsgSamuelSRDone=I have made all the bread.
MsgSamuelSRDoneSure=Are you sure?|You might want to check again.
MsgSamuelSRDone2=Took you quite some time. Well, we can go on then.
MsgSamuelSRD2_Short=That is enough bread.
MsgSamuelSRDone3=Yes?
MsgSamuelSRWhatNext=What now?
MsgSamuelSRStartPaula=Why you ask me? Ask Paula what you can do for her.
MsgSamuelSRDoPaula=I suggest you do what Paula asked you to do.
MsgSamuelSRP_Short=Go speak|to Paula now.
MsgSamuelSRProceedY=We have all the supplies.
MsgSamuelSRProceedN=Nothing.
MsgSamuelSREnd=Excellent. Good job.
MsgSamuelMQ1=You better get going.
MsgSamuelMQ2_Friendly=The flamethrower has real punch. Still, I advise you to make a bow and arrows in the armory. For good measure.
MsgSamuelMQ2_Unfriendly=Since you refused the flamethrower, I suggest you make yourself a bow and a lot of arrows in the armory. I hope that doesn't go against your moral standards.
MsgSamuelMQ2_Short=You should prepare|a few weapons.
MsgSamuelMQ3=You could also do us a favour: there is a rare species of mushroom growing in the Dark Forest's ground that would help Paula heal more quickly.
MsgSamuelMQ4=You'll probably have to search the earth and dig around to find it. Just if you find the time to do that.
MsgSamuelMQ4_Short=Look underground|for these mushrooms.
MsgSamuelMQ5=Have you found the bunker yet?
MsgSamuelMQ6=How's the metal coming?
MsgSamuelMQNo=Not yet.
MsgSamuelMQLight=I need light to enter the forest.
MsgSamuelMQLightLost=I lost the lamp.
MsgSamuelMQLight_Friendly=Yes, indeed. Take this lamp with you. It's sturdier than torches but don't drop it!
MsgSamuelMQLF_Short=Take this lamp|with you.
MsgSamuelMQLight_FriendlyLamp=What happened to that lamp? You can also always build torches.
MsgSamuelMQLight_FLL=Well...I do have another one. Please don't lose this one, will ya?
MsgSamuelMQLight_FLL2=Sorry, I don't have any more lamps. You need to build torches now.
MsgSamuelMQLight_Unfriendly=That's why it's called the Dark Forest. You should build torches.
MsgSamuelMQPaula=How is Paula?
MsgSamuelMQPaulaOkay=As I said, okay for now. You worry about that metal.
MsgSamuelMQPaula_Short=Paula is fine but|we need the metal.
MsgSamuelMQMushroom=I brought one of those healing mushrooms.
MsgSamuelMQMushroomExcellent=Excellent, Newbie. That helps.
MsgSamuelMQME_Short=Thanks for|the mushroom!
MsgSamuelMQMushroomBurned=Great effort, Newbie, but this one really looks well done. A burned mushroom will do us no good.
MsgSamuelMQMB_Short=That mushroom|is burned.
MsgSamuelMQMushroomWhere=Where is it then?
MsgSamuelMQDoor=I found it but the door is closed.
MsgSamuelMQDoorBoom=So? Do you lack imagination? We don't have a key, that thing has been abandoned for years. Just blow the door up.
MsgSamuelMQDB_Short=You can blast|the bunker door.
RndSamuelSR1=Where did I|leave that?
RndSamuelSR2=Yes, this works.
RndSamuelSR3=This looks wrong.
RndSamuelSR4=Hmmm.
RndSamuelSR5=Just a few|more corrections.
RndSamuelSR6=Now, that's perfect.
RndSamuelSR7=Complete rubbish.
RndSamuelSR8=Well, that|needs redoing.
RndSamuelSR9=Stupid thing.
RndSamuelSR10=A few drops|of oil here.
